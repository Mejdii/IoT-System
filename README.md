## My Feedback
I want to thank you for giving me the opportunity to work on such an awesome challenge. In fact, this is my first time that I developed a node.js app for connecting IoT devices, I used to use Python and cloud platforms/services when I work on IoT projects but I use JS when I program rule chain' nodes. I also use embedded C language when it comes to connect sensors to gateways.

Actually, I found node.js such a nice environment for connecting devices as it has a plenty of modules. I personally don't have any problem in learning and practicing any programming language. Indeed, a couple of months ago at Huawei, I learned to write scripts with a programming language that I've never heard about which is MML language :)


## Timing:
I received the challenge on Thursday 22th, I spent some weekend time learning JavaScript and discovering node.js modules.
I started coding on Sunday 25th I finish it at the same day.

**Total coding time**: Around 4h.

**Total Learning, Researching, and running test time**: 7h.
